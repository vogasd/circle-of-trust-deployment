Build a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline. Your solution should:
• Define build, test, and deploy stages using Jenkins.
• Include pre-deployment tests (unit/integration) to validate code quality.
• Monitor, Log and Audit the system
• Integrate vulnerability scanning (SAST/SCA) and policy enforcement.
• Implement an automated deployment and rollback strategy.
• Describe a GitOps-based approach for declarative, drift-free deployments.

Deliverables: Pipeline configuration files (YAML or similar).
